Key Management System for Cosmos Validators.

https://cosmos.network/

## About

This repository contains `tmkms`, a lightweight service intended to be deployed
alongside the `gaiad` service (ideally on separate physical hosts) which provides
the following:

- **High-availability** access to validator signing keys
- **Double-signing** prevention even in the event the validator process is compromised
- **Hardware security module** storage for validator keys which can survive host compromise

## Status

Early adopters interested in using YubiHSM2 devices for Cosmos Validator key
storage can install the (forthcoming) `tmkms` v0.0.1 "Preview Release" using
the instructions below.

NOTE: This release does not yet support validator signing. See the following
issues for the remaining blockers:

- [ ] [Cosmos address (Bech32) support](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/issues/65)
- [ ] [Update to new signing message format & integration test](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/pull/55)
- [ ] [Full integration tests: Tendermint <-> KMS](https://github.com/tendermint/kms/issues/44)

## Supported Platforms

`tmkms` should build on any [supported Rust platform] which is also supported
by [libusb]. Here are some of the available tier 1, 2, and 3 Rust platforms which
are also supported by **libusb**:

NOTE: `tmkms` is presently tested on Linux/x86_64. We don't otherwise guarantee
support for any of the platforms below, but they theoretically meet the necessary
prerequisites for support.

### Operating Systems

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD

### CPU Architectures

Rust supports the following CPU architectures:

**Tier 1:**

a.k.a. "guaranteed to work"

- `i686` (32-bit Intel)
- `x86_64` ("AMD64", "x64") - recommended

**Tier 2:**

a.k.a. "may work". Note that hardware accelerated AES (used for communication
with YubiHSM2) is not supported on these platforms and they have not been
rigorously tested for side-channel attack resistance.

- `arm` (32-bit ARM)
- `aarch64` (64-bit ARM)
- `mips` (32-bit MIPS)
- `mips64` (64-bit MIPS)
- `powerpc` (32-bit PowerPC)
- `powerpc64` (64-bit PowerPC)
- `sparc64` (64-bit SPARC)

## Installation

You will need the following prerequisites:

- **Rust** (stable; 1.27+): https://rustup.rs/
- **C compiler**: e.g. gcc, clang
- **pkg-config**
- **libusb** (1.0+). Install instructions for common platforms:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
  - RedHat/CentOS: `yum install libusb1-devel`
  - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install libusb`

To install `tmkms`, do the following:

1. (x86_64 only) Configure `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable: `export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes`
2. Run the following to install Tendermint KMS using Rust's `cargo` tool:

```
$ cargo install tmkms
```

3. Copy the example `tmkms.toml` file to a local directory (e.g. `~/.tmkms`):

https://github.com/tendermint/kms/blob/master/tmkms.toml.example

Edit it to match your desired configuration.

## YubiHSM2 Setup

YubiHSM2 devices from Yubico are the main HSM solution supported by
Tendermint KMS at this time (Ledger support forthcoming!)

The `tmkms yubihsm` subcommand provides YubiHSM2 setup, information, and
testing features:

- `tmkms yubihsm detect` - list all YubiHSM2 devices detected via USB
- `tmkms yubihsm keys` - manage keys on the device
  - `tmkms yubihsm keys generate <id>` - generate an Ed25519 signing key with the given ID number (e.g. 1)
  - `tmkms yubihsm keys list` - list all Ed25519 signing keys in the YubiHSM2
  - `tmkms yubihsm keys test <id>` - perform a signing test using the given key

## Development

The following are instructions for setting up a development environment.
They assume you've already followed steps 1 & 2 from the Installation
section above (i.e. installed rustup and the noted nightly Rust released).

- Install **rustfmt**: `rustup component add rustfmt-preview`
- Install **clippy**: `rustup component add clippy-preview`

Alternatively, you can build a Docker image from the [Dockerfile] in the top
level of the repository, which is what is used to run tests in CI.

Before opening a pull request, please run the checks below:

### Testing

Run the test suite with:

```
cargo test --all-features
```

### Format checking (rustfmt)

Make sure your code is well-formatted by running:

```
cargo fmt
```

### Lint (clippy)

Lint your code (i.e. check it for common issues) with:

```
cargo clippy
```
