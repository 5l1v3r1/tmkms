Key Management System for Cosmos Validators.

https://cosmos.network/

## About

This repository contains `cosmos-kms`, a lightweight service intended to be deployed
alongside the `gaiad` service (ideally on separate physical hosts) which provides
the following:

* **High-availability** access to validator signing keys
* **Double-signing** prevention even in the event the validator process is compromised
* **Hardware security module** storage for validator keys which can survive host compromise

## Installation

NOTE: Cosmos KMS is not ready for general use.

No releases of Cosmos KMS are presently available. Eager early adopters can
build and install the latest code from `master` as follows:

1. Install rustup (the Rust installer): https://rustup.rs/
2. Install Rust nightly: `$ rustup install nightly-2018-06-02`
3. Run the following to install Cosmos KMS from `master`:

```
$ cargo +nightly-2018-06-02 install --git https://github.com/tendermint/kms
```

Cosmos KMS presently requires a nightly Rust release. It should be able to
support stable Rust after the 1.27 stable release.

## Configuration

The `kms.toml.example` file contains an example configuration for the KMS.
Copy it to your preferred location, rename it to `kms.toml`, and edit it
to match your preferred configuration.

## Development

The following are instructions for setting up a development environment.
They assume you've already followed steps 1 & 2 from the Installation
section above (i.e. installed rustup and the noted nightly Rust released).

1. Install **rustfmt**: `rustup component add rustfmt-preview --toolchain nightly-2018-06-02`
2. Install **clippy**: `cargo +nightly-2018-06-02 install clippy`
3. Clone the repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/tendermint/kms`
