Key Management System for Cosmos Validators.

https://cosmos.network/

## About

This repository contains `cosmos-kms`, a lightweight service intended to be deployed
alongside the `gaiad` service (ideally on separate physical hosts) which provides
the following:

* **High-availability** access to validator signing keys
* **Double-signing** prevention even in the event the validator process is compromised
* **Hardware security module** storage for validator keys which can survive host compromise

## Installation

NOTE: Cosmos KMS is not ready for general use.

No releases of Cosmos KMS are presently available. Eager early adopters can
build and install the latest code from `master` as follows:

- Install rustup (the Rust installer): https://rustup.rs/
- Configure `RUSTFLAGS`: `export RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes`
- Run the following to install Cosmos KMS from `master`:

```
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/tendermint/kms
```

Cosmos KMS builds on Rust 1.27+ (stable).

## Configuration

The `kms.toml.example` file contains an example configuration for the KMS.
Copy it to your preferred location, rename it to `kms.toml`, and edit it
to match your preferred configuration.

## Development

The following are instructions for setting up a development environment.
They assume you've already followed steps 1 & 2 from the Installation
section above (i.e. installed rustup and the noted nightly Rust released).

1. Install Rust nightly: `rustup install nightly-2018-07-14`
1. Install **rustfmt**: `rustup component add rustfmt-preview --toolchain nightly-2018-07-14`
2. Install **clippy**: `cargo +nightly-2018-07-14 install clippy --version 0.0.212`

Alternatively, you can build a Docker image from the [Dockerfile] in the top
level of the repository, which is what is used to run tests in CI.
